**Features:**
- Sulphur Ore naturally generating in the Basalt Deltas of the Nether
- Sulphur item
- Sulphur Block
- Charcoal Block
- Recipe for Gunpowder
- Lava Bucket fuel source buff

## Summary
The Sulphur Ore can be an interesting obstacle in the Nether, if you step on the wrong one (that is in contact with a Magma Block, Lava or Fire) it will trigger a small explosion causing you potential trouble

Its a minable ore that will give you Sulphur as a drop when mined with a tool above Wood, it works with both Fortune (giving 2 on any level), and Silk Touch.

Sulphur can be used as a better fuel source than Coal, and can be combined with Charcoal crafting 2 gunpowder (alternative block recipe - Block of Charcoal + Sulphur Block = 18 gunpowder)

The Ore itself can be used as a strip-mining tool as it is reactive with itself (any explosion) and can be blown up with either a Flint and Steel or a flaming Arrow

The same goes for the Sulphur Block - which is a lot more explosive than the ore counterpart

## Values
- The Charcoal Block burns for 16200 ticks (810 sec)
- Sulphur in its item form burns for 3000 ticks (150 sec)
- Sulphur Block burns for 32000 ticks (1600 sec)
- The Lava Bucket got buffed as a fuel source - burning for 39000 ticks (1950 sec)

- Sulphur Ore explodes with radius of between 1 and 2 depending on the source
- Sulphur Block has a strength between 2 and 3.7

## Planned features:
- Config file letting you toggle features and change values
- Going with that a (disabled by default) reverse recipe for Sulphur itself (if lets say Nether is disabled or you turn off its generation)
